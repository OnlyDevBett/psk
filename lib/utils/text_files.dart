String about = 'PASUNE was formed in the year 2000. '
    'It was formed on the need to standardize the operations of paralegals under '
    'the civil society organizations who were its members. At the time many of '
    'its members that were undertaking paralegal initiatives, '
    'approached it differently including the identification of '
    'who could be a paralegal, the content of training, '
    'the methodology of trainings and the role played by paralegal '
    'trainees. PASUNE was therefore formed to address these '
    'issues and thus coordinate and monitor paralegal activities.';
